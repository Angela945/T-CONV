# T-CONV:A Convolutional Neural Network For Multi-scale Taxi Trajectory Prediction
This program is base on theano, it has two part:
- the global CNN part(T-CONV-Basic)
- local enhancement CNN part(T-CONV-LE)
Run the conn-global-real.py for global part and the conn-2-local.py for local enhancement part.
